# NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Stats Scraper

This Python project scrapes Division I Women's Soccer team stats from the [NCAA website](https://www.ncaa.com/stats/soccer-women/d1) and compiles them into master CSV files for analysis.  

Itâ€™s designed to:  
- Automatically fetch all available team statistics.  
- Handle multiple pages per stat category.  
- Merge all stats into a single **master CSV** (`team_master.csv`).  
- Log stats that fail or contain only null values.  
- Be easily updated as NCAA updates stats.

> **Note:** Individual player stats scraping is currently commented out and will be added later. This version focuses on team stats only.
